#Time Complexity: O(n) because we make n recursive calls.
#Space Complexity: O(n) because each recursive call adds a layer to the call stack, using more memory.

# Problem 4: Recursive Power of 2
# Time Complexity: O(log n) because each recursive call reduces the problem size by half.
#Space Complexity: O(log n) due to the recursion stack depth, also reducing by half each time.
